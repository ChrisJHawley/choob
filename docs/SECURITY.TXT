Current security system:

The UserNodes tables contains both users and groups.

users have NodeClass 0, user owned groups 1, plugin owned groups 2, system
groups 3.

Group names are of the form {user|plugin|system}.groupname. User and plugin
groups are of the special form user.userName.groupName and
plugin.pluginName.groupName, as well as their root groups of user.userName etc.

Users are free to create groups under their own group heirarchy and add users
to it, likewise plugins. Any group external to this must have
group.add.{user|plugin|system}.whatever permission and to add members,
group.addMembers.whatever.

Permissions can be granted by anything with permission.grant.whatever
where whatever is the group name. Permissions are applicable ONLY to groups.
This means to grant a permission to user foo, you grant them to group
"user.foo". The user.foo group should be used to hold linked nicknames for user
"foo".
